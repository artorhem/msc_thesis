\chapter{Lay Summary}

People are increasingly using mobile devices to share digital content with each other. While this is convenient and easy to do, they must trust in good faith that the recipient to handle the data as per their wishes. This is not always the case and there are many data leaks that point to this. There is a need to let the users control access to their data even after they have shared it with someone they have no influence over.

We present TrustedCapsules, a system that enables users to define an access policy for their data that is guaranteed to be followed on the recipients device. Our contribution here is this cross-device access control abstraction that works with unmodified applications. We design this system around hardware enabled security guarantees, and evaluate our prototype to show that it imposes a reasonable slowdown when compared to regular file access.
